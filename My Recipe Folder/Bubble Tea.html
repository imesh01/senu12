            Put the teabags or tea leaves in 100ml boiling water and leave 
            to brew for 10-15 mins.<br> Discard the teabags or tea leaves, 
            then set the tea aside to cool to room temperature.<br> To make a clear sugar syrup, 
            stir the caster sugar with 60ml water in a small saucepan<br> over a medium
             heat and bring to the boil.<br>
             Remove from the heat and leave to cool.

    Bring 500ml water to a rolling boil in a small saucepan set over a
    medium heat,<br>
    then add the tapioca balls. Using a rubber spatula, <br>
     stir the water and make sure the balls,
     or boba, are not sticking to the side of the pan. <br>
    Turn the heat up to reach a rolling boil for 2 mins, then turn off 
    the heat,but keep the pan on the stove with a <br>lid on for another 2 mins. 
    Drain the boba <br>in a sieve under gentle running tap water<br> for about 20 seconds to slow down the cooking. Using the same spatula, gently push the<br> boba around in the mesh to make sure they don’t stick and are cooling down evenly. <br>Once they're cool to the touch,
  set in a mixing bowl, add the 1 tsp dark brown sugar and mix<br> in
    thoroughly.

To make the sugar syrup, add the 50g dark sugar to 60ml water <br>
in the same pan set over a medium heat. Slowly stir and let it come to a boil,<br>
making sure all the sugar has dissolved. Turn off the heat and leave to cool down.<br>
It will thicken as it cools. This will make approx. 80ml syrup, about 2½ servings.<br>
Any leftover syrup will keep in a jar in the fridge for up to a month.<br>
       Add the cooked boba and mix until thoroughly coated.<br>
       The boba can be left covered for up to three hours.<br>
       Do not refrigerate as they will harden.<br>
